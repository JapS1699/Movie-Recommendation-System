# Movie-Recommendation-System
This Movie Recommendation System is a Python-based application that recommends movies based on the genre selected by the user. 
It uses a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction, where the user inputs their preferred genre and user ID. 
The backend of the system is built with Python, utilizing the pandas library to handle and filter movie data, and the surprise library to implement a collaborative filtering recommendation model using the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithm.
The system predicts ratings for unrated movies and recommends the top-rated ones based on the userâ€™s preferences.
